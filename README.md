## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SK0511-data/cardiovascular-risk.git
   cd cardiovascular-risk
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the analysis**:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

## Visuals

This project includes several visualizations to help interpret the data and results, such as:

- Distribution plots of cardiovascular risk factors
- Correlation heatmaps
- ROC curves for model performance
- Feature importance graphs

You can find example visual outputs in the `notebooks/` or `images/` directory, or generated during analysis.
To view or generate visuals, run the associated scripts or notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory.

## Methods & Findings

### Methods

- Data preprocessing: cleaning, normalization, and feature selection
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Predictive modeling using machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forest)
- Model evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC)

### Findings

- Key risk factors identified for cardiovascular events
- Model performance metrics and comparisons
- Insights from data visualization

Detailed methods and findings are documented in the project notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory.
